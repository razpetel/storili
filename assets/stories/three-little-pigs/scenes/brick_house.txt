Strong brick house on a gentle hill where all pigs are safe.

## Base Prompt
A sturdy red brick house with a smoking chimney sits proudly on a gentle green hill. The house has a strong wooden door, cute shuttered windows, and a neat brick path leading to it. Three happy little pigs peek out from different windows, waving. The silly wolf sits exhausted on the ground outside, red-faced and out of breath. Warm golden afternoon sunlight. Classic storybook watercolor illustration style, soft textures, child-friendly, triumphant atmosphere.

## Key Elements
- Red brick house (sturdy, strong)
- Chimney with cozy smoke

## Variant: Wolf Huffing
Wolf taking a huge breath, cheeks puffed out comically. Pigs watching from windows with amused expressions.

## Variant: Wolf Defeated
Wolf walking away with slumped shoulders, looking embarrassed. Maybe a tiny rain cloud over his head. Pigs cheering in windows.
